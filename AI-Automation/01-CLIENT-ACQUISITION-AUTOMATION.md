Quick question: When someone Googles "[SERVICE] near me" at 11 PM, do they find YOU?

Most local businesses lose 3-5 customers per week to competitors with better online presence.

Subject: How [COMPETITOR_NAME] stole your customers

[FIRST_NAME],

While researching [SERVICE_TYPE] in [LOCATION], I found something interesting...

[COMPETITOR_NAME] ranks #1 on Google for "[SERVICE] [LOCATION]"
Their website gets your customers 24/7.

Meanwhile, potential customers searching for you find:
❌ Outdated contact info
❌ No mobile optimization  
❌ Slow loading times

We just launched 3 [SERVICE_TYPE] businesses to #1 in their area.
Same result for [COMPANY_NAME]?
