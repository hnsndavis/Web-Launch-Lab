## 📧 **Step 4: Set Up Email Integration (15 minutes)**

### **Connect Your Email System**:

1. **Go to Clay Integrations**
2. **Connect Gmail or Outlook**
3. **Set up sending domains** (if you have them)
4. **Configure email templates**

### **Email Template 1: "Website Audit"**
```
Subject: Quick website question for {{company_name}}

Hi {{first_name}},

I was researching {{industry}} businesses in {{city}} and noticed {{company_name}}.

Quick question: Are you happy with how many customers find you online?

I just helped {{similar_business_example}} increase their leads by 340% with a simple 7-day website refresh.

Worth a quick look at your current setup?

P.S. - This audit takes 2 minutes and shows exactly what's costing you customers.
```

### **Email Template 2: "Local Competition Alert"**
```
Subject: {{competitor_name}} is outranking {{company_name}} online

{{first_name}},

I was doing local SEO research and found something you should know...

{{competitor_name}} appears first when people search for "{{service}} {{city}}"

Their website gets YOUR potential customers 24/7.

Meanwhile, your website:
- Loads in {{page_speed}} seconds (should be under 3)
- Isn't mobile-optimized for {{mobile_percentage}}% of searchers
- Last updated {{days_since_update}} days ago

Want to see how to flip this in your favor?
