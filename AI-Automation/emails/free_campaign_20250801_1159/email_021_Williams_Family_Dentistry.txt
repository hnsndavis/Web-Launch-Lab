Subject: Williams Family Dentistry - Missing online presence costing customers?

Hi Michelle,

I was researching Law Firm services in your area and came across Williams Family Dentistry.

I noticed something that might be costing you customers: I couldn't find a website for Williams Family Dentistry online.

This means when potential customers search for "law firm" services at 9 PM or on weekends, they're finding your competitors instead of you.

Here's what this could be costing you:
• 70% of customers research online before calling
• Businesses without websites lose 5-10 customers per week
• Your competitors are capturing YOUR potential customers 24/7

I just helped another law firm business launch their website in 7 days and they're already booking 40% more appointments.

Worth a quick 15-minute conversation to show you exactly how this could work for Williams Family Dentistry?
