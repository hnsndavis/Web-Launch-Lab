Subject: Smith Dental Practice website analysis - found some concerns

Hi John,

I was doing research on dental practices in your area and took a look at Smith Dental Practice's online presence.

I found a few things that might be costing you patients:
• Website loads in 6.1 seconds (should be under 3)
• Not optimized for mobile devices
• Website appears to be 2 years old

The impact? Potential patients are likely choosing your competitors simply because they found them first and had a better online experience.

I just helped a similar dental practice fix these exact issues in 7 days, and they increased their patient bookings by 340%.

Want to see exactly how we could do the same for Smith Dental Practice?

    if website_data['load_time'] > 3:
        score += 40  # Higher penalty for slow sites
    
    # Add industry-specific scoring
    if 'healthcare' in business.get('industry', '').lower():

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Issue**: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bs4'"
```bash
# Solution:
pip3 install beautifulsoup4
```

**Issue**: Websites timing out or loading slowly
```python
# Solution: Increase timeout in requests
response = self.session.get(url, timeout=15)  # Increased from 10
```

**Issue**: Getting blocked by websites
```python
# Solution: Add more realistic headers and delays
self.session.headers.update({
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36'
})
time.sleep(random.uniform(2, 5))  # Longer delays
```

**Issue**: Low lead scores across all businesses
```python
# Solution: Adjust scoring algorithm
if website_data['load_time'] > 2:  # Lower threshold
    score += 20  # Lower penalty
```
